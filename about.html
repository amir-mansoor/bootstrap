      <h4>Team</h4>
      <p>Team Bootstrap is maintained by a small team of developers on GitHub. Weâ€™re actively looking to grow this team
        and would love to hear from you if youâ€™re excited about CSS at scale, writing and maintaining vanilla JavaScript
        plugins, and improving build tooling processes for frontend code.</p>

      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the most popular
        front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.

        Bootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to being an open-sourced framework,
        Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into development, Twitter held its first Hack Week and
        the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the
        style guide for internal tools development at the company for over a year before its public release, and
        continues to do so today.

        Originally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, weâ€™ve since had over twenty releases, including two major
        rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an
        optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive
        by default with a mobile first approach.

        With Bootstrap 4, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural changes: a migration to
        Sass and the move to CSSâ€™s flexbox. Our intention is to help in a small way to move the web development
        community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties, fewer dependencies, and new technologies across more
        modern browsers.</p>
